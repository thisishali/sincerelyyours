					<h3>Sincerely yours,</h3>
					<p>This website is an fun experiment, during which I applied the HTML, CSS and Javascript skills I picked up, and to use this site as a portfolio to show potential employers.</p>
					
					<p>Besides the basic HTML/CSS to create the basic layout I also implemented some Javascript to connect the gallery overlay to the pictures and the corresponding side text.</p>
					
					<p>Responsive breakpoints have been implemented, to allow the website to be viewed on mobile devices such as tablets and smart phones.</p>

					<h3>Tic Tac Toe</h3>
					<p>Tic Tac Toe was a game app for which I did the concept and design. Starting from sketches, I worked my way up to conceptual wireframes and finally did colors, UI elements and styles in the Adobe programs.</p>
					<p> Besides the classical tictactoe the app is supposed to offer an ancient greek game mode called "Terni Lapili", a 9x9 Meta tic tac toe and a quattro level, which are playable against the computer as well as a friend on the same device. A competitive online-mode was intended for a later update.</p>

				<h3>Design school website v02</h3>
				<p>This is a one-pager which is the second draft I did for the simplification of the design school website. Since it's a dynamic website, content is generated when you choose either one of the options, while you stay on the same website. To do it this way would serve the user's orientation and understanding of the website structure.</p>

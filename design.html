				<h3>Wedding newspaper</h3>
				<p>A newspaper I designed for my brother's wedding. In collaboration with friends and family of the future spouses we collect pictures, stories and interview texts, which I assembled in a layout. </p>
				<p>Since the production was financed by friends themselves, the contents had to be as compact as possible without leaving out any of the material gathered.</p>
				<p>The product has 28 pages printed on 7 sheets of satin-finished digital printing paper.</p>
